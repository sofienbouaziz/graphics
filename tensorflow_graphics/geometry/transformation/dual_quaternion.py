"""This module implements TensorFlow dual quaternion utility functions.

A dual quaternion is an extension of a quaternion with the real and dual parts
and written as $$q = q_r + epsilon q_d$$, where $$epsilon$$ is the dual number
with the property $$e^2 = 0$$. It can thus be represented as two quaternions,
and thus stored as 8 numbers. We define the operations in terms of the two
quaternions $$q_r$$ and $$q_d$$.

Dual quaternions are extensions of quaternions to represent rigid
transformations (rotations and translations). They are in particular important
for deforming geometries as linear blending is a very close approximation of
closest path blending, which is not the case for any other representation.

Note: Some of the functions expect normalized quaternions as inputs where
$$|q_r| = 1$$.
